# UI Utility/Comonent Library

A dynamic Uitity/Component library developed with React/Typescript distributing both CommonJS and ESM. Components are tested with the JEST testing framework and documented with an interactive Storybook server. This repo is a WIP and is not stable or production ready at this stage.

## React

## React-dom

## @types

## TypeScript

## Prettier

## Storybook

## JEST

## Sass / CSS

#### Syntatically Awesome StyleSheets

Sass was the chosen pre-processor for numerous reasons, but mainly the syntax, nesting, and variable capabilities. Structure and best practices will be an area of focus in future development of this library.

#### Cascading StyleSheets

Auto-generated with the script `sass --watch input.sass : output.css`. This is going to be migrated into an npm command within the package.json file, but holding off for init commit.

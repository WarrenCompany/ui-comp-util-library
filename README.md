## Contribution
### Create a Branch:

git checkout -b { utility || component } / { change }
```

```
#### Types:
- ` Feat: ` for adding net new (or fully redesigned) features into the codebase
- ` Fix: ` for bug fixes, refactors, and optimizations to the existing codebase
- ` Chore: ` for making minor changes to the casebase (i.e. versioning, migrations, etc.)
- ` Misc: ` for everything else -- last resort tag

Use ` --no-verify ` to skip linting

### Push a Branch:
```
git push -set--upstream origin { branch_name }
```
